## Workshop 5

House keeping:  

## RECORD!!!!! 

1. Assignment due today by midnight 

2. Next assignment will be next class after reading break. These assignments really go hand in hand. First looking at the topic and second pulling your research together into a proposal of what you want to build to explore the topic.  

3. Scope is a thing, You've got 2 months so don't sell yourself short but take into consideration you familiarity with the tech you're using and the time it will take to explore that.  

4. I'd suggest thinking about one point of polish for the pieces. This point of polish will also lend itself nicely to the next assignment, you technical sketch.  

5. Question about assignment for today or next week?
